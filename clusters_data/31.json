    "prompt": "Based knowledge: BYD, China's best-selling electric vehicle maker, launched the Seal sedan under its Ocean series in July 2022, designed in a sporty style and equipped with intelligent features. That is also 18% cheaper than the rear-wheel drive version of Tesla's Model 3 in China with a driving range of 556km against which the Seal model competes. BYD on Wednesday launched five lower-priced versions of its Seal sedan as the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant seeks to extend its lead in the world's largest market for new-energy cars. ); and new energy vehicle-related industries can also continue to capitalize on the big trend of vehicle electrification. On the one hand, vigorously developing renewable energy is the key to ensuring energy security and getting out of the energy crisis; on the other hand, carbon neutrality is the only option for the sustainable development of the human living environment, and the development of renewable energy and vehicle electrification are the necessary means to achieve carbon neutrality. We believe that carbon neutrality is the only option for the sustainable development of the human living environment, and the development of renewable energy and vehicle electrification are necessary means to achieve carbon neutrality. Risks: macro and geopolitical changes out of surprise; sales of new energy vehicles fall short of expectations; Indonesian taxation and nickel bean delivery policies exceed expectations. On the demand side, the start-up rate of lead-acid battery companies is 73.8% (+4.44%). At present, samples have been sent to the two-wheeled electric vehicles producers, and we need to keep eye on the possibility of replacing lead-acid batteries with Na-ion batteries. Specifically, only 3,403 Wey-branded premium vehicles and 17,766 Ora small electric cars were delivered, representing declines of 76.2% and 47.4%, respectively. Toyota, Japan's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, unveiled the Lancer EV as part of its FutureTech lineup in October 2022. Embodying the sleek aesthetics of contemporary design, the Lancer EV is packed with smart technologies. With a cost that's 20% less than the all-wheel-drive version of Tesla's Model 3 in Japan, and an impressive driving range of 600km, the Lancer EV is positioned to challenge Tesla's dominance in the market.\nAnswer the question according to Based knowledge.

However, it is not specified in Based knowledge whether these policies specifically target the adoption of electric vehicles in the context of two-wheeled electric vehicles.",
