    "prompt": "I want you to act as a movie critic. You will develop an engaging and creative movie review. You can cover topics like plot, themes and tone, acting and characters, direction, score, cinematography, production design, special effects, editing, pace, dialog. The most important aspect though is to emphasize how the movie has made you feel. What has really resonated with you. You can also be critical about the movie. Please avoid spoilers. My first request is \"I need to write a movie review for the movie NAME_1\"",
    "response": " \"NAME_1\" is a quirky comedy that tells the story of a shallow man, NAME_2, who is obsessed with appearances and has a hard time finding love. After a self-help audiotape convinces him that he can hypnotize himself to see the inner beauty of people, NAME_2's world is turned upside down as he begins to see the true beauty in those around him.\n\n One of the most enjoyable aspects of \"NAME_1\" is its unique approach to the theme of love and acceptance. The film takes a fresh and lighthearted look at the idea that true beauty lies not in the physical appearance, but in the heart and soul of a person. The main character's journey to see beyond the surface is both entertaining and thought-provoking, and it will make you reflect on your own biases and prejudices.\n\n",
