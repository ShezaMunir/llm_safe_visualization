Thus, \"Early games\" is a vague reference that should be replaced by \"The early games that were played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public\". Thus, the revised response is:\n```\nThe early games that were played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public were not accessible to the general public.\n```",
            "is_relevant": "The subject of the QUESTION is \"video game.\" The subject of the STATEMENT is \"early games that were played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public.\" The phrase \"These early games were typically played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public\" from the RESPONSE shows that the relationship between \"video game\" and \"early games that were played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public\" is that the early games were not accessible to the general public. For this reason, the subjects \"video game\" and \"early games that were played on large mainframe computers and were not accessible to the general public\" are [Foo]."
