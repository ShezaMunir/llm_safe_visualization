Create a dictionary with the data you want to convert to a DataFrame:\n```\ndata = {'Name': ['NAME_1', 'NAME_2', 'NAME_3'],\n        'Age': [25, 30, 20],\n        'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male']}\n```\n3. Use the `to_dataframe()` function to convert the dictionary to a DataFrame:\n```\ndf = pd.to_dataframe(data)\n```\n4. Print the resulting DataFrame:\n```\nprint(df)\n```\nThe output of the above code will be:\n```\n    Name  Age  Gender\n0  NAME_1   25  Male\n1  ",
