    "prompt": "What is useLayoutEffect in react?",
    "response": " `useLayoutEffect` is a hook in React that is used to perform side effects after the layout of the component has occurred. It is typically used when you need to perform some data fetching or other state-related operation that should not be shown until the component has finished rendering.\n\n The hook takes an index parameter, which is a unique identifier for the component. When you call the hook with an index value, React will ensure that the component has finished rendering before running theEffect.\n\n Here's an example of how to use `useLayoutEffect`:\n```\nimport { useLayoutEffect } from'react';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  useLayoutEffect(() => {\n    // Perform some data fetching here\n    return () => {\n      //",
